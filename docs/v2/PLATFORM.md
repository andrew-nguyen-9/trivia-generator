# PARLOR v2 — Platform

The pipeline fix (2.1) and the platform-hardening phases (2.13–2.19). Pairs with
`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for the visual ones.

## 2.1 — Pipeline Resurrection

The nightly Action (`.github/workflows/etl_daily.yml`) has failed silently for ~a
week. Make it reliable, observable, and self-documenting.

### Diagnosis

- **Primary cause — push race.** Both `etl_daily.yml` (daily) and `wiki_hard.yml`
  (every 6h) end by committing to `main` with **no `git pull --rebase` before
  `git push`**. When `wiki_hard` commits between the daily run's `checkout` and its
  `push`, the daily push is rejected (non-fast-forward) → the job fails and nothing
  is committed.
- **Compounded by zero observability.** No Slack/email/issue on failure; every
  ingest is `continue-on-error: true`, so total data decay looks like success.
- **Secondary candidate — permissions.** Repo "Workflow permissions" must be
  *Read and write* (README documents this); a reset would also break the push.

### Fix recipe

1. **Serialize + rebase.** Add a shared `concurrency` group across **both** workflows
   (e.g. `group: bank-writer`, `cancel-in-progress: false`) so they never push
   concurrently, **and** `git pull --rebase origin main` immediately before
   `git push` in both. (Belt and suspenders: the concurrency group prevents the
   race; the rebase recovers if anything still lands in between.)
2. **Assert permissions.** Add job-level `permissions: { contents: write }` to the
   publish job and the wiki_hard job; verify repo Settings → Actions → Read and
   write.
3. **Observability.** Add an `if: failure()` step that opens/updates a GitHub issue
   via `gh issue create` (label `pipeline-failure`), with the failing job + run URL.
   Optional Slack webhook behind a secret.
4. **Health gate, not silent decay.** After the forge, fail the run if total forged
   questions (or per-source fact counts) fall below a threshold — replace blanket
   `continue-on-error` tolerance with a real floor. Surface the dbt
   `mart_category_stats` health report as a check, not just a log line.
5. **Propagate real failures.** Make `export_seed.py`'s "refusing to export" and any
   dbt test failure exit non-zero with a clear message so the workflow goes red
   (today some failures are swallowed).

### Runbook (for future Claude)

**Symptoms**: seed bank stale; `data/raw/*.jsonl` mtimes old; no recent
`parlor-etl` commits; Actions tab shows red `etl_daily`.

**First checks** (read-only):
- Actions tab → latest `etl_daily` run → which job failed (extract / transform /
  publish).
- `git log -1 --format=%an data/raw/` — last author + date of a bank refresh.
- Compare `etl_daily` vs `wiki_hard` run times — overlap suggests the push race.
- Repo Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions = Read and write?

**Known causes → fix**:
- Push rejected (non-fast-forward) → the race; ensure concurrency group + rebase
  are in place (fix #1).
- `Permission denied`/`403` on push → permissions (fix #2).
- Publish skipped → dbt tests failed in transform (by design); read the test output;
  fix the data or the test.
- "refusing to export" → bank regressed in category spread; check ingests produced
  data (health gate, fix #4).

**Verify a fix**:
- `cd pipeline && python selftest.py` (offline) must pass.
- Re-run via `workflow_dispatch`; confirm a green run **and** a fresh commit to
  `data/raw` + `frontend/public/seed-questions.json`.
- Deliberately break a step on a scratch branch to confirm the failure issue opens.

### Done-when

A `workflow_dispatch` run goes green and commits a fresh bank; a deliberately broken
run opens an issue; `data/raw` mtimes are current; runbook is in this doc.

## 2.13 — SEO

Per-route Next `metadata` (unique title/description in the mystery voice);
`app/sitemap.ts` + `app/robots.ts`; OG/Twitter cards using the seal; JSON-LD
structured data (WebSite, and per-game where it fits). **Done-when**: sitemap +
robots resolve, every route has unique metadata, OG previews render.

## 2.14 — Accessibility

- Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` across **all** v2 motion — the card deck (2.2), the
  Streak flame + darkness (2.6), the 404 cards (2.19): static/eased fallbacks, no
  perpetual animation.
- **Color-blind-safe**: never encode category by color alone — pair with suit/glyph/
  label (constrains `CATEGORY_HEX` usage).
- Readable type scale + contrast (WCAG AA); focus-visible states.
- ARIA + full keyboard play for every room; the Map pin, the year slider, the
  card flips all keyboard-operable.
- **Done-when**: reduced-motion kills non-essential animation; categories
  distinguishable without color; rooms keyboard-playable; axe/Lighthouse a11y clean.

## 2.15 — Light/Dark Mode

Implement the two themes from `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` ("candlelit" dark, "daylit" light)
by remapping semantic tokens; system preference + persisted manual toggle; SSR-safe
(no flash; obey `lib/rng.ts` SSR rules). **Done-when**: toggle persists, both themes
coherent, no hydration flash.

## 2.16 — Performance

Reduce cache/CPU/GPU/API load; make it fast everywhere.

- Audit Framer Motion usage (no perpetual off-screen animation — a11y + perf win).
- Lazy-load heavy rooms/assets (the `WorldMap` topojson is already lazy; extend the
  pattern); size all images (`next/image`); minimize `"use client"` surface.
- Cache headers (`vercel.json` already sets immutable image caching) + sensible
  data caching.
- **Gate**: `chrome-devtools` `lighthouse_audit` + `performance_*` traces; record
  before/after.
- **Done-when**: documented Lighthouse perf gains, no gameplay regressions.

## 2.17 — Mobile

Touch-first: adequate touch targets, responsive room layouts, the card deck reflowed
for small screens, gesture support (swipe/drag where natural). **Done-when**: every
room usable + correct on a phone viewport (playwright mobile emulation passes).

## 2.18 — Cross-Browser

Chrome / Safari / Firefox parity via `playwright` multi-engine runs. Watch the known
gotchas: `backdrop-filter`, `AudioContext` unlock (Safari), `background-clip: text`
(used in the hero), SVG/topojson rendering. **Done-when**: playwright passes on all
three engines; gotchas resolved.

## 2.19 — Site Pages

- **About** — the Secret Order lore + what PARLOR is (mystery/intrigue framing).
- **Sitemap page** — human-readable index of rooms + pages (complements 2.13's
  `sitemap.xml`).
- **404** — floating cards that **bounce off the frame edges and against any text**,
  and on specific actions arrange into **magical shapes** (reuse the 2.2 card-motion
  vocabulary; reduced-motion fallback per 2.14).
- **Footer** — present site-wide; navigation **back to the an9.dev site**.
- **Done-when**: `/about`, sitemap page, 404, and footer all live + linked. After
  this PR merges, v2 is feature-complete → open the single `v2 → main` PR, tag
  `v2.0.0`.

## Branding cleanup (req #13, executed in 2.2, tracked here)

Remove "after-dark" everywhere and reframe to mystery/intrigue. Known references at
v1 (re-grep before editing, line numbers drift):

- `README.md` — title "an after-dark house of trivia games"
- `docs/archive/GAME_MODES.md`, `docs/archive/UI_SPEC.md` — archived; leave as v1
  history (do not rewrite archived docs).
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` — "members' entrance · after dark" microlabel
- GitHub repo **description** — update to the mystery framing.

Verify with `grep -ri "after.dark"` over the live tree (excluding `docs/archive/`)
returning empty.
